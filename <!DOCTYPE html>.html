            <h2> Genesis Rosales</h2>
            <p>Hello my name is Genesis Rosales, i am from San Francisco CA. Here is a little about myself, since i can remeber 
                i've always liked learning new things, i am always picking up a knew hobby and i enjoy keeping myself busy. After 
                graduating high school i got into the Dental field, got a job right away as a dental assistant and continued to 
                attend school part-time to one day become a Dental Hygienist because it was always a passion of mine. After covid hit
                 and affected everyones lives i was out of work for about two months, during that time i was helping 
              two of my closest friends who started their own businees i helped them with their website, i had so much fun doing it so then 
              i dicided to which up my carrer and get out of my comford zone and enroll to a boot camp for web development. I've 
              always been interested in learning how things work and how you can make websites and create a whole asthetic. that is why i cant
               wait to see learn as much as i can in this cpurse. After i complete the program i wiil continue to always 
               learn and hope to be part of a great team where we can grow together as web developers.
